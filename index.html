        I'm an aspiring game developer, enthusiastic and eager to learn through internships in the dynamic world of game development. Despite being a beginner, my lifelong passion for gaming has driven me to explore the foundations of this field through online resources and hands-on experimentation. I've already undertaken small personal projects to apply my knowledge and gain valuable insights into the complexities of game development. My primary goal is to secure an internship to bridge the gap between theory and practice, learn from experienced professionals, and contribute my passion and dedication to creative teams. I believe my fresh perspective, insatiable curiosity, and commitment to growth make me a valuable addition to any game development team. I'm excited to connect with mentors, educators, and fellow developers who can guide me on this journey, and I see internships as a mutual exchange of knowledge and inspiration. I'm ready to take on the challenges, collaborate, and make a meaningful impact in the gaming industry. Thank you for considering my application, and I look forward to the opportunities ahead.      </p>

  <h2>Car Racing 3D</h2>
  <div class="project-description">
    <h3>Project Description</h3>
    <p>I created "Car Racing 3D," a fun 3D racing game with help from a YouTube tutorial. I added a steering system for precise control and designed a menu for players to pick their favorite cars. I also improved the game by making opponent cars follow specific paths, added a pause menu for convenience, and expanded the car options by modifying their attributes. My project shows how I can enhance a game and make it more exciting, providing players with a diverse and enjoyable experience.</p>
